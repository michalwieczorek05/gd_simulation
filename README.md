*GDSimulation* is a python program for doing lattice simulations of the evolution of scalar fields in an expanding Universe. The program enables to perform the simulations for the fields-space manifolds characterized by the non-zero curvature. Up to my knowledge, it is the first program with this feature, which uses the symplectic numerical method. The usage of such method is crucial to preserve the high accuracy of the obtained solution in case of very long simulations with the number of time steps to be of order $10^6$ or higher. The detailed instructions, how to use the program, as well as, the further description of its potential applications can be found in the pdf document *gd_simulation_docs.pdf*.
